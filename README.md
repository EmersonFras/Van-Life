# Van Life

Van Life is a project created as part of the **Learn React Router 6** course on Scrimba. The primary goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience with React Router 6 and its functionalities, such as routing, nested routes, dynamic routes, and more. While the website mimics a van rental service, it is not intended to be a fully functional application.

## Project Overview

Van Life simulates a platform where users can "rent" vans for their adventures. It provides:

- A homepage introducing the service.
- A van listing page displaying available vans.
- Detailed van pages with individual van information.
- User-friendly navigation using React Router.

This project focuses on learning how to build a modern single-page application (SPA) using React Router.

## Live Demo

You can view the deployed version of the project here: [Van Life on Netlify](https://rr-van-life.netlify.app)

## Learning Objectives

Through this project, you will:

- Understand the basics of React Router 6.
- Set up and configure routes in a React application.
- Work with nested routes and layouts.
- Use dynamic routing to display specific content.
- Implement navigation and links to create a seamless user experience.
- Handle URL parameters and query strings.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router 6**: A routing library for React.
- **JavaScript**: Core language for building the application.
- **CSS**: For basic styling. Mostly supplied through Scrimba's course (as this is not the main learning objective) with small changes made by myself.

## Notes

This project is for educational purposes only and is not intended for production use. It focuses on teaching React Router concepts and may not include comprehensive functionality or advanced error handling.
